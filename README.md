# RCE3D
## Description
RCE3D stands for Rainstorm Console Engine 3D but this is actually a simple real-time ray tracer. It uses [RCEngine](https://github.com/rainstormstudio/RCEngine), meaning that it only uses SDL2 for graphics. However, CUDA is used for optimizing the performance of the ray tracer.
